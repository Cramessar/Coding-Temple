⚔️ Classes and Personalities
Each class in this game is inspired by iconic characters from Final Fantasy X. Pick your fighter wisely!

🗡️ Warrior (Auron): Stoic, wise, and determined. He drinks from a jug and swings swords bigger than your future. Special move: Bushido: Dragon Fang.

✨ Mage (Lulu): Calm, collected, and a little sassy. She’ll cast Thundaga while judging your life choices. Special move: Fury: Thundaga.

🖤 Black Mage (Dark Lulu): Mysterious and brooding. Her magic hits harder than your Monday mornings. Special move: Fury: Flare.

💣 Rogue (Rikku): Playful and mischievous. She’ll steal your wallet and blow you up. Special move: Mix: Chaos Grenade.

🏹 Archer (Wakka): Laid-back and confident. Throws blitzballs and questionable jokes. Special move: Overdrive: Status Reels.

🛡️ Paladin (Yuna): Pure-hearted and brave. She’ll heal you, smite you, and give a heartfelt speech while doing it. Special move: Grand Summon: Holy.

🎶 Why Final Fantasy X is the Best (Don’t @ Me)
If you're reading this, you probably already know that Final Fantasy X is a masterpiece. But if you need convincing (or if you just want to relive the glory), here’s why:

A Story That Hits Hard: A tale of love, loss, and blitzball. You laugh, you cry, and you question the meaning of life (and spheres).

Tidus’ Laugh: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! It’s a meme, it's cringe, it’s a mood, it’s art.

Auron’s Cool Factor: He’s the guy who shows up, drops wisdom bombs, and disappears into the night. The man personifies the meme, ""I have two jobs I drink and I know things."

Yuna’s Summons: They’re huge, they’re epic, and they give you that feeling of “Yeah, I’ve got this!” (until you don’t).

The Music: From the emotional To Zanarkand to the headbanging Otherworld, every track is a banger. You have no idea the restraint it took to not put hymn of the fayth as the background music for this whole project.

Blitzball: It’s confusing, it’s infuriating, and somehow, you can’t stop playing it.

Spira: A world filled with beauty, heartbreak, and fiends who want to ruin your day. Just like real life.

Final Fantasy X is the game that made us all feel things while wielding oversized swords and casting spells. And this little project is a love letter to that magic.

Also your boy needs the points on the project for creativity but we don't need to talk about that.
